[Agent Skills](docs/SKILL-FORMAT.md) are small capability files an AI agent loads only when it
needs them. This repo gives your agent **68 game-dev skills** and a **router** that picks the
right ones for you. You describe what you're building; the agent loads the matching engine and
task skills before it writes code.

- **Cross-engine.** Godot, Unity, Unreal, Phaser, PixiJS, three.js, Bevy, pygame, LÖVE, Roblox.
- **You don't pick skills.** The router detects your engine and task and loads only what fits.
- **Art direction, not one-off generations.** The asset workflow locks a visual target, builds
  families, normalizes outputs deterministically, and checks them inside the game.
- **Built to trust.** Every skill is written from primary docs, version-pinned to a stated
  engine release, and checked by a [validator](scripts/validate-skills.py). Current baselines and
  upgrade policy live in [version support](docs/VERSION-SUPPORT.md).

## Quick start

**One project-local command, any agent.** The [`skills`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skills) CLI
detects the coding agent you already use and installs a user-reviewed commit of the router plus
skills into the current project:

```bash
npx skills add gamedev-skills/awesome-gamedev-agent-skills@<reviewed-commit>
```

Add `--list` to preview first, or `-a <agent>` to target a specific tool (`-a cursor`,
`-a claude-code`, `-a gemini-cli`, …). Do not use `-g`; review and deliberately select a new
commit when updating. The same `SKILL.md` files load
natively in Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Codex, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Kiro, and
[dozens more](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) — there's nothing to convert.

**Claude Code plugin (alternative).** This repo is also a Claude Code plugin marketplace, so you
can install it with Claude's own commands:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add gamedev-skills/awesome-gamedev-agent-skills
claude plugin install gamedev@awesome-gamedev-agent-skills
```

Building in only one engine? Install a smaller bundle — `router` plus your engine:

```bash
claude plugin install router@awesome-gamedev-agent-skills
claude plugin install godot@awesome-gamedev-agent-skills    # or: unity · unreal · web-engines · other-engines
```

Prefer to copy the files by hand, or want the exact per-tool paths? See
**[`docs/INSTALLATION.md`](docs/INSTALLATION.md)**.

Want to read the catalog as web pages instead? Every skill, engine group, and per-agent install
path is browsable at
**[gamedev-skills.github.io/awesome-gamedev-agent-skills](https://gamedev-skills.github.io/awesome-gamedev-agent-skills/)**,
generated straight from the `SKILL.md` files in this repo.

Then just talk to your agent — see below.

## What you can ask

Describe the task in plain language. The router figures out the skills:

| You say | Skills it loads for you |
|---------|-------------------------|
| "add a double jump to my Godot player" | `godot-2d-movement` + `platformer` |
| "make an inventory for my Unity RPG" | `unity-scriptableobjects` + `rpg` + `save-systems` |
| "procedural dungeon roguelike in Godot" | `godot-tilemap` + `procedural-gen` + `roguelike` |
| "make a cohesive pixel-art player, enemies, and tiles" | `create-game-assets` + the detected engine importer |
| "how should I design save slots?" | `save-systems` |
| "publish my game on itch with butler" | `itch-publish` |

You never type the skill names on the right. That's the router's job.

## How the router picks skills

You never name a skill. On each request the router does three things:

1. **Detects your engine** from project files — a `project.godot` means Godot, a `*.uproject`
   means Unreal, and so on. If it can't tell, it just asks.
2. **Reads your request** for the task — a concept (AI, shaders, saving), a genre (platformer,
   roguelike), or a shipping step (game jam, Steam).
3. **Loads only the matching skills**, in order: engine basics first, then the concept, then any
   genre glue. It re-routes if you switch to something new.

That's why "add a double jump to my Godot player" loads `godot-2d-movement` + `platformer` and
nothing else.

<details>
<summary>The exact detection signals and routing table</summary>

The full algorithm — every engine fingerprint, the task-to-skill table, and how engine,
discipline, genre, and workflow skills compose — lives in the router skill itself:
[`router/SKILL.md`](router/SKILL.md). In short: engine selection is exclusive (exactly one
engine), while disciplines, genres, and workflows are additive on top.

## Agent compatibility

Every skill here is a plain `SKILL.md` folder in the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open
standard — the format Anthropic launched as Claude Skills — metadata plus a Markdown playbook the
agent reads on demand.

The same file loads **natively** across the ecosystem: Claude Code, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf,
Cline, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Kiro, Antigravity, VS Code, and
[many more](https://agentskills.io/clients). There are no editor-specific rule files to maintain
and nothing to convert.

**Install with one command.** The universal CLI detects your agent and writes the skills to the
right place:

```bash
npx skills add gamedev-skills/awesome-gamedev-agent-skills@<reviewed-commit>
```

**Or copy by hand.** Drop a skill's `<name>/` folder into your agent's skills directory:

| Agent | Skills directory |
|-------|------------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` |
| Codex · Gemini CLI · GitHub Copilot · Antigravity | `.agents/skills/` _(shared path)_ |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` _(also reads `.agents/skills/`)_ |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/skills/` |
| Cline | `.cline/skills/` |
| Kiro | `.kiro/skills/` |

The exact per-agent paths, triggers, and the handful of optional fields that vary by agent are in
[`docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Demo

One plain-English request goes in; the minimal right skills come out, then version-pinned code.
Here's the shape of a single exchange (illustrative):

```text
> add a double jump to my player

Detected Godot (project.godot). Loading godot-2d-movement for the controller
and platformer for jump feel — skipping the other 66 skills.
```

```gdscript
extends CharacterBody2D

@export var speed := 220.0
@export var jump_velocity := -380.0
@export var max_jumps := 2

var _jumps_left := max_jumps

func _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:
    if not is_on_floor():
        velocity += get_gravity() * delta   # Godot 4.7 baseline
    else:
        _jumps_left = max_jumps

    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_accept") and _jumps_left > 0:
        velocity.y = jump_velocity
        _jumps_left -= 1

    velocity.x = Input.get_axis("ui_left", "ui_right") * speed
    move_and_slide()
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the authoring standard
in [`docs/SKILL-FORMAT.md`](docs/SKILL-FORMAT.md). Every skill must pass the validator and the
rubric before merge:

```bash
python scripts/validate-skills.py
```
