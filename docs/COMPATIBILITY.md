# Compatibility

Every skill in this repository is a plain `SKILL.md` folder in the
[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard: YAML frontmatter (`name` + `description`)
followed by a Markdown playbook, with optional `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/`. The
standard was created by Anthropic and released as an open format; it is now read **natively** by a
large and growing set of AI coding agents and IDEs. There is no editor-specific rule file to
maintain and nothing to convert — the same file installs everywhere.

For step-by-step install commands, see [`INSTALLATION.md`](INSTALLATION.md).

## TL;DR

- **A skill is just a folder with a `SKILL.md`.** Agents preload only `name` + `description`, then
  read the body when a request matches, then read bundled files on demand (progressive disclosure).
- **It's broadly supported.** Claude Code, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, OpenAI Codex, Gemini
  CLI, GitHub Copilot, Kiro, Antigravity, VS Code, Roo Code, Junie, Trae, Factory, Tabnine, OpenCode, Goose and
  [many others](https://agentskills.io/clients) load the standard directly.
- **One installer covers all of them.** `npx skills add gamedev-skills/awesome-gamedev-agent-skills@<reviewed-commit>`
  detects the agents you have installed and copies the skills (router included) to the right place.
- **The skills here use only the portable core**, so a single tree works in every agent — no
  per-tool variants.

## Install in one line

The [`skills` CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skills) is the package manager for the Agent
Skills ecosystem. Use it only for project-local installs from a reviewed commit or tag; do not
use global installation or automatic updates. Review the resolved files first and use a trusted
npm mirror:

```bash
# install a reviewed commit into the current project
npx skills add gamedev-skills/awesome-gamedev-agent-skills@<reviewed-commit>

# preview without installing
npx skills add gamedev-skills/awesome-gamedev-agent-skills@<reviewed-commit> --list

# target a specific agent; do not add -g
npx skills add gamedev-skills/awesome-gamedev-agent-skills@<reviewed-commit> -a cursor
```

This repo ships a Claude marketplace manifest. The master [`router/`](../router) skill is
discovered alongside the catalog under `skills/`. Claude Code users can alternatively use the
native plugin commands (see [`INSTALLATION.md`](INSTALLATION.md)); Codex is supported through the
standard `.agents/skills/` layout and universal installer.

## Where each agent looks for skills

Skills should install per-project (committed with your repo), not globally (every project). Paths can change
as tools evolve, so the `skills` CLI is the most reliable installer; the table below lists the
documented project locations and how each agent triggers a skill. Each row links to that agent's
own skills documentation.

| Agent | Project skills directory | How it triggers | Docs |
|-------|--------------------------|-----------------|------|
| **Claude Code** | `.claude/skills/` | auto by description · `/skills` | [docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) |
| **Claude** (claude.ai) | upload the skill as a `.zip` | auto in chat | [docs](https://support.claude.com/) |
| **Cursor** | `.agents/skills/` or `.cursor/skills/` | auto by description · `/skill-name` | [docs](https://cursor.com/docs/skills) |
| **Windsurf** (Cascade) | `.windsurf/skills/` | auto by description · `/skill-name` | [docs](https://docs.windsurf.com/) |
| **Cline** | `.cline/skills/` (also reads `.claude/skills/`) | auto (`use_skill`) · `/skill-name` · *enable in Settings* | [docs](https://docs.cline.bot/customization/skills) |
| **OpenAI Codex** | `.agents/skills/` | `$skill` · `/skills` · implicit | [docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills) |
| **Gemini CLI** | `.agents/skills/` or `.gemini/skills/` | activation + consent · `/skills` | [docs](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills/) |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `.agents/skills/` | auto by description | [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills) |
| **Antigravity** (Google) | `.agents/skills/` (default; also global `~/.gemini/config/skills/`) | auto by description | [docs](https://antigravity.google/docs/skills) |
| **Kiro** | `.kiro/skills/` (+ `~/.kiro/skills/`) | auto by description · `/skill-name` | [docs](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/skills/) |
| **Others** (VS Code, Roo Code, Junie, Trae, Factory, Tabnine, OpenCode, Goose, …) | see each tool | varies | [client list](https://agentskills.io/clients) |

`.agents/skills/` is the shared, cross-agent convention that many tools read, which is why one copy
there can serve several agents at once. The `skills` CLI maps each agent to its correct location
automatically, so you rarely need to track these by hand.

> **Kiro note.** The default Kiro agent auto-loads skills from `.kiro/skills/` and
> `~/.kiro/skills/` with no extra setup. A **custom** agent must opt in via its `resources`, e.g.
> `"resources": ["skill://.kiro/skills/**/SKILL.md"]`.

> **Cline note.** Skills are an experimental feature — enable them under
> **Settings → Features → Enable Skills** before they appear.

## Compatibility boundary

A basic skill—`name`, `description`, a Markdown body, and optional `scripts/`, `references/`, and
`assets/`—is the shared contract. Clients may expose extra behavior, but extension keys and plugin
metadata are not assumed to be portable. Every committed `SKILL.md` therefore uses only the two
required frontmatter fields. Agent presentation lives beside the skill, such as
`agents/openai.yaml`, and distribution metadata lives at repository root.

## What's in a committed `SKILL.md` (the portable core)

- **Frontmatter:** exactly `name` (1–64 chars; lowercase, digits, hyphens; equals the folder name)
  and `description` (≤1024 chars; says *what it does* **and** *when to use it*).
- **Body:** the open-standard playbook — when-to-use, workflow, patterns, pitfalls, references —
  kept under ~500 lines, with depth pushed into `references/`.

The validator rejects extra frontmatter in this catalog and checks bundled OpenAI metadata
separately. This keeps the source unambiguous while recognizing that the open specification defines
optional fields other repositories may choose to use.

## Verify after installing

1. List installed skills — `npx skills list` (without updating), or `/skills` inside agents that expose it.
2. Ask a prompt that should route — e.g. *"set up a tilemap with autotiling in Godot"* — and
   confirm the router loads the matching skill(s) before it edits code.

## Why this is portable

The standard formalizes two things: **progressive disclosure** (metadata → body → resources) and a
tiny required frontmatter contract (`name` + `description`). Any agent that implements the standard
can load any compliant skill, so a correct `SKILL.md` is portable by construction — the broad
adoption above is what turns "write it once" into "runs everywhere."
